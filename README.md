# Library-Management-System-in-java-with-GUI
This admin-controlled project uses a database to manage books and students. Admins can add books, register students, issue books, and track returns. The system records borrowed books, due dates, and fines for late returns. Secure access ensures only admins can modify data, ensuring smooth library management.
